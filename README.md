# deep-learning-final-project

My final project for Deep Learning class as part of the University of Iowa, MS Business Analytics. I compared the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using three different sets of text vector embeddings on a binary text classification problem. Using a dataset of Amazon reviews, I compare a CNN that trains its own embeddings against pretrained vector embeddings from GloVe and FastText. The self-trained embeddings result in the best model validation performance. I then use Keras Tuner to perform hyperparameter tuning of the best model. Finally, I used the distilBERT pretrained model to perform binary text classification on the same Amazon Reviews dataset. The pretrained distillBERT results in astonishing performance off the shelf, demonstrating the power of transfer learning in NLP.
